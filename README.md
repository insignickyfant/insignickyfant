- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicky!
- 👀 I’m interested in gamifying life through the use of mobile applications. I also like veterinary medicine, psychology and\
     &emsp;&nbsp; extreme sports.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and Java and I'm also taking Harvard's CS50 Computer Science course.\
     &emsp;&nbsp; This is next to the courses I'm currently taking to complete my Veterinary Medicine Bachelor's degree {\
     &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;  Locomotion, Clinical Reasoning and Diagnostics, Surgery and Multi-organ diseases }.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning the basics of game development.

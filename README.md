- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicky!
- 👀 I’m interested in gamifying life through the use of mobile applications. I also like veterinary medicine, psychology and extreme sports.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C and Java and I'm also taking Harvard's CS50 Understanding Technology course.
      This is next to the courses I'm currently taking for my veterinary medicine degree (Statistics and Economics, Veterinary Public Health, Locomotion).
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning the basics of game development.
- 📫 You can reach me as insignickyfant at stack overflow.

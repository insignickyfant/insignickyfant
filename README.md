- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicky!
- 👀 I’m interested in gamifying life through the use of mobile applications. I also like veterinary medicine, psychology and\
     &emsp;&nbsp; extreme sports.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Science with a Game Technology track.\
     &emsp;&nbsp; The courses I'm taking currently are: {\
     &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Databases,\
     &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Game Design,\
     &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Game Programming.\
     &emsp; &nbsp;}

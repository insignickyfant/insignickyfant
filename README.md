- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicky!
- 👀 I am passionate about understanding human psychology and helping people understand themselves and their actions better. I’m also interested in using psychological principles to gamify the study of complex subject matter, so it could be more accessible to people with non-standard learning styles.
- 🌱 I’m currently studying Computer Science with a Game Technology track.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning the basics of game development.

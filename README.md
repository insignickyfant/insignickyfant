- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicky
- 👀 I’m interested in gamification applications, veterinary medicine and psychology.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C, Java and taking Harvard CS50's Understanding Technology course.
      This is of course next to the courses I'm currently taking for my veterinary medicine degree (Statistics and Economics, Veterinary Public Health, Locomotion)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning the basics of game development.
- 📫 You can reach me as insignickyfant at stack overflow.

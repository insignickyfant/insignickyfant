- 👋 Hi, I’m Nicky!
- 👀 I’m interested in gamifying life through the use of mobile applications. I also like veterinary medicine, psychology and\
     &emsp;&nbsp; extreme sports.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Java, I'm taking Harvard's CS50 Computer Science course and writing my Bachelor Thesis.\
     &emsp;&nbsp; This is next to the courses I'm taking to complete my Veterinary Medicine Bachelor's degree, i.e. {\
     &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Locomotion,\
     &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Clinical Reasoning and Diagnostics,\
     &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; Surgery and Multi-organ diseases.\
     &emsp; &nbsp;}
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on learning the basics of game development.
